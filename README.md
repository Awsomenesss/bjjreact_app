**_BJJconnect - Project Portfolio 5 - Advanced Front End (React)_**

Bjj connect is developed and submitted as my fifth Profile Portfolio Project as part of the Advanced Frontend specialization for Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development. The website is used by a fictional online community of BJJ(Brazilian jiu-jitsu) to share memories and events scheduled for the future.

  ## **[UX and UI Design](#ux-and-ui-design)**

   ### **UX Design**

   The UX design process involved creating 2 wire frame pages , the home page and  the profile page. 

![Balsamiq wieframes 1](src/assets/readMe_images/homepage.PNG)
  ### **UI Design**
   
   Given the nature of the project being a social platform, it was paramount that the aesthetic served a range purposes. The main priority is :

   - **Readability and Accessibility**:  The use of a white background (#ffffff) is a classic choice that provides a clean and uncluttered canvas. This high-contrast background is beneficial for readability as it makes text and other elements stand out clearly while the consistent use of Roboto Condensed makes it easier to read at various sizes and resolutions.

   - **Feedback and Interactivity**: the standard expectations of today's users around UI had to be considered. This project attempts to use these taken-for-granted expectations to maximise the impact of basic features on the user, such as changing the color of a button when it's hovered over or clicked.
Often, websites opt for more subtle and subdued shifts between colors to notify users of any data changes happening and to provide real-time feedback to users. SpoodleSapce uses both subtle color themes familiar to users and then loud unexpected strong contrasting colors to achieve a more intense and enhanced UI depending on the context. 

   - **Consistency Across Components**: the styling defined in each of the separate CSS modules reuses a color scheme that can be efficiently applied to the different components as needed, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

   **Color Scheme**

   The main colors applied throughout the project are:
  - `#f8f8f8`
  - `#ffffff`
  - `#525252`
  - `#013af7`
  - `#cfced3`
  - `#2142b2`
  - `#f1f1f1`
  - `#888`
  - `#555`
These colors are used for background colors, text colors, and border colors.

The front-end library chosen for the project was [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) to combine the component-based approach of React with the styling and design principles of Bootstrap. The advantage of this decision was directly linked to the tight timeframe for delivering a MVP. Its 'out of the box' components and pre-built styles removed a significant amount of the time and energy required. Other advantages of its key features for this project include:

- React Components: It provides React-compatible versions of Bootstrap components, allowing developers to use them in their React applications seamlessly.

- Responsive Design: React Bootstrap components are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

- Customization: While React Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components, developers can still customize and extend these components to meet the specific requirements of their applications.

- Integration: React Bootstrap can be easily integrated into existing React projects. Developers can import individual components or the entire library based on their needs.

- Maintained and Updated: React Bootstrap is actively maintained and updated to align with the latest versions of React and Bootstrap.

### [**Agile Development Process**](#agile-development-process)

  - Github Projects was used to structure the workflow. 
  - View the Project on Github [**Here**](https://github.com/users/Awsomenesss/projects/19)

To achieve the site goals outlined in the User Stories section above, the development process was divided into sprints with three categories using the MoSCoW method. This helped prioritize the implementation of features based on their importance.

- **Must Have**

  - User Authentication: Users can create an account, sign in, and sign out.
  - User Profiles: CRUD functionality for users to personalize their presence on the website through profile pages.
  - Followers Feed: Users can view a list of posts by other users they are following. The logic for this feature can be found in the `utils.js`, `ProfileDataContext.js`, and `ProfilePage.js` files.
  - Liked Feed: Users can view a feed of posts they have liked. This feature is implemented in the `Navbar.js` component.
  - Image Posts: Users can create, read, update, and delete posts with images, titles, and descriptions.
  - Custom Models and Forms: Three custom models and corresponding forms with CRUD functionalities that are relevant to the site goal.
  - README.md files for the frontend and backend repositories.
  - Testing


- **Should Have**

  - Infinite Scroll: Implementing infinite scroll functionality for an improved user experience.
  - Search Bars: Users can search for posts and navigate to pages related to the three custom models and forms.

- **Could Have**

   - Online Resources: A feature that provides users with access to relevant websites and a list of online resources related to the site goal.

- **Would Have**

    - Add functionality to upload video to posts.
    - events to be location specific
 
### [**Typography**](#typography)

- The main font-family used throughout the project was "Roboto Condensed", "sans-serif". 

- These fonts were chosen for their well-defined letterforms, making it easier for users to read content and the limited use of fontes allow consistency in typography across the app. 

### [**Main Features**](#main-features)

 - Each of the features and goals for every User Stories outlined in detail above were implemented.

 - The React library provided menu of reusable components that were vital to allowing me using specific element across multiple features on the frontend on the project. These invaluable components saved me an immeasurable amount of time. I either customized or relied heavily on the following to meet the site goal:

    - Assets.js
    - Avatar.js
    - MoreDropDown.js
    - ProfileEditDropdown.js
    - Navbar.js 
    - NotFound.js
 **Asset.js**

    This component can display an image, a spinner, and/or a message to the user depending on the circumstances. It accepts the following props:

    - `spinner`: A boolean indicating whether to display a spinner animation.
    - `src`: The source URL of an image.
    - `message`: A message to display.

    **Avatar.js**

      This component is used to display the user's personalised avatar with an image they are able to choose. It accepts the following props:

      - `src`: The source URL of the avatar image.
      - `height`: The height of the avatar image.
      - `text`: Text to overlay on the avatar.

    **MoreDropdown.js**

      This component represents a dropdown menu with options for the user to edit and delete details as needed. It uses Bootstrap's Dropdown component and accepts two callback functions:

      - `handleEdit`: A callback function for the edit action.
      - `handleDelete`: A callback function for the delete action.

      **ProfileEditDropdown.js**

      Similar to `MoreDropdown`, this component allows the user to use a dropdown menu with options for editing their profile. It accepts the `id` of the profile to determine where to redirect for editing.

      **NavBar.js**

      This component provides navigation links and icons based on whether a user is logged in or not. It includes features such as sign out and dynamic icons based on a user's authentication status.

      **NotFound.js**

      This component is used to display a "Not Found" message along with an image when a user tries to access a non-existent page. It uses the `Asset` component to display the image and message.

### [**Features for the future**](#features-for-the-future)

  Features planned for future implementation are:

   - modify the like and feed to include events alongside posts
   - Functionality for eventes to be location specific

### [**Testing**](#testing)

- **Code Validation**
    ![JSX Compiler](/src/assets)

- **Lighthouse Testing**
 This project has undergone development with a primary focus on functionality and features. While it delivers the intended functionality, it's important to note that the current version have performance issues that result in lower Lighthouse scores and slower load times.

the low score is consistent across all pages the below shows the lighthouse score accros the main pages. Optimization will be carried out after the assessment
