**_BJJconnect - Project Portfolio 5 - Advanced Front End (React)_**

Bjj connect is developed and submitted as my fifth Profile Portfolio Project as part of the Advanced Frontend specialization for Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development. The website is used by a fictional online community of BJJ(Brazilian jiu-jitsu) to share memories and events scheduled for the future.

  ## **[UX and UI Design](#ux-and-ui-design)**

   ### **UX Design**

   The UX design process involved creating 2 wire frame pages , the home page and  the profile page.

  ### **UI Design**
   
   Given the nature of the project being a social platform, it was paramount that the aesthetic served a range purposes. The main priority is :

   - **Readability and Accessibility**:  The use of a white background (#ffffff) is a classic choice that provides a clean and uncluttered canvas. This high-contrast background is beneficial for readability as it makes text and other elements stand out clearly while the consistent use of Roboto Condensed makes it easier to read at various sizes and resolutions.

   - **Feedback and Interactivity**: the standard expectations of today's users around UI had to be considered. This project attempts to use these taken-for-granted expectations to maximise the impact of basic features on the user, such as changing the color of a button when it's hovered over or clicked.
Often, websites opt for more subtle and subdued shifts between colors to notify users of any data changes happening and to provide real-time feedback to users. SpoodleSapce uses both subtle color themes familiar to users and then loud unexpected strong contrasting colors to achieve a more intense and enhanced UI depending on the context. 

   - **Consistency Across Components**: the styling defined in each of the separate CSS modules reuses a color scheme that can be efficiently applied to the different components as needed, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

   **Color Scheme**

   The main colors applied throughout the project are:
  - `#f8f8f8`
  - `#ffffff`
  - `#525252`
  - `#013af7`
  - `#cfced3`
  - `#2142b2`
  - `#f1f1f1`
  - `#888`
  - `#555`
These colors are used for background colors, text colors, and border colors.

The front-end library chosen for the project was [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) to combine the component-based approach of React with the styling and design principles of Bootstrap. The advantage of this decision was directly linked to the tight timeframe for delivering a MVP. Its 'out of the box' components and pre-built styles removed a significant amount of the time and energy required. Other advantages of its key features for this project include:

- React Components: It provides React-compatible versions of Bootstrap components, allowing developers to use them in their React applications seamlessly.

- Responsive Design: React Bootstrap components are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

- Customization: While React Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components, developers can still customize and extend these components to meet the specific requirements of their applications.

- Integration: React Bootstrap can be easily integrated into existing React projects. Developers can import individual components or the entire library based on their needs.

- Maintained and Updated: React Bootstrap is actively maintained and updated to align with the latest versions of React and Bootstrap.
